# Process per file pairs 

## Problem 

You need to process the files into a directory grouping them by pairs. 

## Solution 

Use the [Channel.fromFilePairs](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/channel.html#fromfilepairs) method to create a channel emitting the file pairs matching a glob pattern. The pattern must match a common prefix in the paired file names.

The matching files are emitted as tuples in which the first element is the grouping key of the matching files and the second element is the file pair itself. 


## Code

```nextflow 

Channel
    .fromFilePairs('reads/*_{1,2}.fq.gz')
    .set { samples_ch }

process foo {
  input:
  set sampleId, file(reads) from samples_ch

  script:
  """
  your_command --sample $sampleId --reads $reads
  """
}

```    

## Custom grouping strategy

When needed it is possible to define a custom grouping strategy. A common use case is for alignment BAM files (`sample1.bam`) that come along with their index file. The difficulty is that the index is sometimes called `sample1.bai` and sometimes `sample1.bam.bai` depending on the software used. The following example can accomodate both cases. 

```nextflow 

Channel
    .fromFilePairs('alignment/*{.bam,.bai}')  { file -> file.name.replace('.bai','').replace('.bam','') }
    .set { samples_ch }

process foo {
  input:
  set sampleId, file(bam) from samples_ch

  script:
  """
  your_command --sample $sampleId --bam ${sampleId}.bam
  """
}

```
